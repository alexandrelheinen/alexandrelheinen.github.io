        <h2 class="section-title">Profile</h2>
        <p class="profile-summary">
            <strong>Experienced R&D engineer and technical leader</strong> with 8+ years building autonomous 
            systems from scratch into industrialization and deployment. Recently, acted as a Founding Engineer
            of <a href="https://harmattan.ai/blog">Harmattan AI</a>, France's first Defense Tech unicorn, which reached
            a $1B+ valuation in under 2 years! This last experience proved to be the most complete so far: there 
            I performed technical hands-on tasks by architecting and coding the full flight stack of the first 
            UAVs developed by the company, structured CI/CD pipelines, simulation frameworks, built the lab
            infrastructure, and worked on hiring the incoming new engineers for this promising team.
        </p>
        <p class="profile-summary">
            Although I have deep expertise in autonomous flying systems, I had the opportunity to work in a wide range of
            industries, including medical robotics, precision agriculture, leisure products, cinematography, industrial inspection,
            ISR, and, as mentioned most recently, the defense industry.
        </p>
        <p class="profile-summary">
            Through these experiences, I learned how to thrive in high-stakes, fast-paced, and international environments, and
            took enormous pleasure in transforming abstract concepts and crude innovation into real and practical products,
            helping minimally trained end users perform the most complex tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="profile-summary">
            Following this trend, I would like to leverage all those success cases and my deep expertise in transforming ideas into
            tangible results, by applying it to create products that have a positive unquestionable impact on people's lives.
